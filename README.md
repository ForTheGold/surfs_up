Analysis of weather in Oahu, Hawaii

## Overview

During a trip to Hawaii last year, I decided that I love to surf.  This has led me to the conclusion that I need to move to Oahu where I can spend a significant amount of my time surfing.  I came up with the idea to open a shop on Oahu called Surf nâ€™ Shake that serves ice cream and rents surfboards to locals and tourists on Oahu.  I have performed an analysis to determine the viability of my idea which can be seen below.

### Purpose

I am looking to move to Oahu where I am going to open up a shop that serves ice cream and rents surfboards to locals and tourists.  I have some money that I would be happy to invest in the shop, but I am going to need some investor backing in order to get the shop up and running.  I have been in contact with an investor named W. Avy who loves to surf and is interested in the shop.  
  
W. Avy is concerned about the weather because of a previous investment.  He previously invested in a surf shop that ended up failing because the weather conditions did not provide a place that would make a successful surf shop.  There was far too much rain in the area.  W. Avy has provided me with some weather data that I have performed an analysis on in order to ease his worries about the risks associated with investing in the shop.

## Results

We would like to ensure that the shop can stay open and be profitable for a good portion of the year.  I have run my analysis on two key months: June and December.  The reason is because we would like to figure out the difference between the two most extreme parts of the year.

### Outcomes

We have started our analysis on the temperature in June and December.  Here are the results from the two months.

December

One of the main things to note is that we have slightly more records for June than we do for December, but this is not a huge difference.  It also seems that we have a sufficient amount of data to be able to draw conclusions from the data.

### Key Differences

It appears that the temperature in Hawaii does not fluctuate all that much, but there are still some differences in temperature between June and December.

* The mean temperature is about four degrees higher in June than in December

As one might expect, it is warmer in June than it is in December.  The mean temperature for June is nearly 75 degrees, while the mean temperature for December is about 71 degrees.  This is not a huge difference in temperature throughout the year which is great news for our business.  It appears that surfing will be able to be enjoyed consistently throughout the year.

* There is a greater variation in the data in December than in June

The standard deviation of the data for the month of June is about 3.25 and it is about 3.75 for the month of December.  This means that the temperature fluctuates to a greater degree in December than it does in June.  This would seem to indicate that there would be more surfable days in June, while there would be some days where many people would choose not to surf in December.  That is acceptable as there will still be a number of days where it would be possible to surf in December.

* The minimum temperature is eight degrees lower in December

We care more about the minimum temperature than we do about the maximum temperature.  It is possible to surf when it is hot, but there is a point when it becomes too cold and people will begin to need a wetsuit in order to surf.  This may be a deterrent for some people and they may not even take their vacation to Hawaii at all if it is too cold.  The low for December is 56 degrees, while it is only 64 degrees for the month of June.  This shows that there are probably more days in December when vacations and surf trips will get cancelled, and that we may need to offer wetsuits for rent as well.

## Summary

The analysis has shown that it is possible to surf in both the winter as well as the summer months in Hawaii.  However, it seems that there are definitely more days that will not be surfable in the winter months.  This is shown by the fact that there is a greater variation in temperature, and that the lows go lower in the winter which is to be expected.  We may need to invest in some wetsuits along with the surfboards in order to stay open in the winter.

### Further Analysis

I would add to this analysis in a number of ways.  First I would check the amount of precipitation that occurs throughout the year.  This is going to be very important as it will not only deter many people from surfing, but may actually cause the conditions to become dangerous to the point where we will need to close the shop.

Additionally, I would check the wind speeds throughout the year.  This is something that could cause the waves to become so strong that beginners will no longer be able to surf.  Most of the people who rent boards are beginners so we need to make sure that we can appeal to our market.
